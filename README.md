_**Ecorise**_ is an app that aims to promote cleaner cities by gameifying the process with in-app rewards for adding and cleaning locations.

Made in **48 hours** for the *2022 Unihack* hackathon.

# How it works
* If you found a location that needs cleaning, press *ping location*
* If you cleaned a location, press on marker at the location
* Watch your trees grow as a reward for contributing to the environment
